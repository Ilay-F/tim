        <h1>Hi</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">Tim Berners-Lee is a software engineer who invented the Internet (or the World Wide
            Web) in 1989 while at
            CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory.

            He is director of the World Wide Web Consortium that he founded and a Professor in the Computer Science
            Department at the University of Oxford.

            In 2001 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 2004 he was knighted.<br /><br />In 1994 Berners-Lee
            founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS) <br>

            Berners-Lee wrote his proposal in March 1989 and, in 1990, redistributed it. It then was accepted by his
            manager, Mike Sendall, who called his proposals "vague, but exciting". Robert Cailliau had independently
            proposed a project to develop a hypertext system at CERN, and joined Berners-Lee as a partner in his efforts
            to
            get the web off the ground. They used similar ideas to those underlying the ENQUIRE system to create the
            World Wide Web, for which Berners-Lee designed and built the first web browser. His software also functioned
            as
            an editor (called WorldWideWeb, running on the NeXTSTEP operating system), and the first Web server, CERN
            HTTPd
            (short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon).
            <br> <br>
            Berners-Lee published the first web site, which described the project itself, on 20 December 1990; it was
            available to the Internet from the CERN network. The site provided an explanation of what the World Wide Web
            was, and how people could use a browser and set up a web server, as well as how to get started with your own
            website. On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee first posted, on Usenet, a public invitation for
            collaboration with the WorldWideWeb project.
